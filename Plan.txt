Essentially Its just like DnD but its not.

Very raw work in progress, I'll take any help I can get.  I was trying to maybe come up with a space ideas.  Got a good deal of story but my programming skills are not that great right now.  I'll post when I started programming Cpp in the bottom.

Oh, I might actually post some story ideas and maybe some art from my girlfriend and friends.  Thanks

GF came up with the idea of oregon trail but with space stuff and also dnd!

Main plan and startup file by Cupsarestupid

Create a random generational maker based on perimeters set out by the user, these
will have these features:

NPC's will not be const...  They will be randomly generated.
These NPC's can have families, be based in their own world, have their
own lives.  We can either set this up to run each instance, or have it persistent
based on the time entering the game, or set on a time frame dictated by some type
of agreement if a community arises.  Since we're talking about space and maybe
the future perhaps gender bias might not dictate offspring?!?

Started programming Cpp in 7.2.2020
